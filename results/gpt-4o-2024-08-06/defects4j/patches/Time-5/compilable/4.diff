-     * Normalizes this period using standard rules, assuming a 12 month year,
-     * 7 day week, 24 hour day, 60 minute hour and 60 second minute,
-     * providing control over how the result is split into fields.
-     * <p>
-     * This method allows you to normalize a period.
-     * However to achieve this it makes the assumption that all years are
-     * 12 months, all weeks are 7 days, all days are 24 hours,
-     * all hours are 60 minutes and all minutes are 60 seconds. This is not
-     * true when daylight savings time is considered, and may also not be true
-     * for some chronologies. However, it is included as it is a useful operation
-     * for many applications and business rules.
-     * <p>
-     * If the period contains years or months, then the months will be
-     * normalized to be between 0 and 11. The days field and below will be
-     * normalized as necessary, however this will not overflow into the months
-     * field. Thus a period of 1 year 15 months will normalize to 2 years 3 months.
-     * But a period of 1 month 40 days will remain as 1 month 40 days.
-     * <p>
-     * The PeriodType parameter controls how the result is created. It allows
-     * you to omit certain fields from the result if desired. For example,
-     * you may not want the result to include weeks, in which case you pass
-     * in <code>PeriodType.yearMonthDayTime()</code>.
-     * 
-     * @param type  the period type of the new period, null means standard type
-     * @return a normalized period equivalent to this period
-     * @throws ArithmeticException if any field is too large to be represented
-     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if this period contains non-zero
-     *  years or months but the specified period type does not support them
