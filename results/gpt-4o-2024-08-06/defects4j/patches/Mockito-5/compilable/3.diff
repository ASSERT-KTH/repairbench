-     * If it is satisfied before the full duration has passed, behaviour is dependent on the returnOnSuccess parameter
-     * given in the constructor. If true, this verification mode is immediately satisfied once the delegate is. If
-     * false, this verification mode is not satisfied until the delegate is satisfied and the full time has passed.
