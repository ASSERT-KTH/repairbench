You are an automatic program repair tool. Your task is to fix the provided buggy code.

The following code contains a buggy function:
```java
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return rangesList.stream()
            .map(RangesList::formatRanges)
            .collect(joining(OR_JOINER));
    }

```

The code fails the following test:
```java
    @Test
    void shouldOmitOuterParentheses() {
        //given
        RangesList rangesList = RangesListFactory.create(">=3.0.0 <=3.0.1");

        //when/then
        assertThat(rangesList.toString()).isEqualTo(">=3.0.0 and <=3.0.1");
    }

```

With the following test error:
```

Please provide a fixed version of the buggy function, and only that function:
