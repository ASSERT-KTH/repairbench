You are an automatic program repair tool. Your task is to fix the provided buggy code.

The following code contains a buggy function:
```java
    /**
     * Sets the given lines for the provided path, overriding any previously existing comments for the path.
     * An entry that is a sole new-line (i.e. "\n") will result in an empty line without any comment marker.
     *
     * @param path the path to register the comment lines for
     * @param commentLines the comment lines to set for the path
     */
    public void setComment(@NotNull String path, @NotNull String... commentLines) {
        comments.put(path, Collections.unmodifiableList(Arrays.asList(commentLines)));
    }

```

The code fails the following test:
```java
    @Test
    void shouldOverrideExistingComment() {
        // given
        CommentsConfiguration conf = new CommentsConfiguration();
        conf.setComment("com.acme", "Acme comment test");
        conf.setComment("other.path", "Some other", "path I am", "adding");

        // when
        IllegalStateException ex = assertThrows(IllegalStateException.class, ()-> conf.setComment("com.acme", "Acme new comment", "1, 2, 3"));

        // then
        assertThat(ex.getMessage(), equalTo("Comment lines already exists for the path 'com.acme'"));

        Map<String, List<String>> allComments = conf.getAllComments();
        assertThat(allComments.keySet(), containsInAnyOrder("com.acme", "other.path"));
        assertThat(allComments.get("com.acme"), contains("Acme new comment", "1, 2, 3"));
        assertThat(allComments.get("other.path"), contains("Some other", "path I am", "adding")); // other one unchanged
    }

```

With the following test error:
```
Expected java.lang.IllegalStateException to be thrown, but nothing was thrown.
```

Please provide a fixed version of the buggy function, and only that function:
