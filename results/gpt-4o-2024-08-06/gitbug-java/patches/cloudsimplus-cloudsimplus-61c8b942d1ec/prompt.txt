You are an automatic program repair tool. Your task is to fix the provided buggy code.

The following code contains a buggy function:
```java
    public HostAbstract(final List<Pe> peList, final boolean activate) {
        this(defaultBwCapacity, defaultStorageCapacity, new HarddriveStorage(defaultRamCapacity), peList, activate);
    }

```

The code fails the following test:
```java
    @Test
    public void integrationTest() {
        simulation.start();
        final DatacenterBroker broker = scenario.getBrokerBuilder().getBrokers().get(0);
        assertThatBrokerCloudletsHaveTheExpectedExecutionTimes(broker);
        assertThatListenersWereCalledTheExpectedAmountOfTimes();
    }

```

With the following test error:
```
org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError
```

Please provide a fixed version of the buggy function, and only that function:
