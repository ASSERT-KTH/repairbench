You are an automatic program repair tool. Your task is to fix the provided buggy code.

The following code contains a buggy function:
```java
    static URL encodeUrl(URL u) {
	    u = punyUrl(u);
        try {
            //  odd way to encode urls, but it works!
            String urlS = u.toExternalForm(); // URL external form may have spaces which is illegal in new URL() (odd asymmetry)
            urlS = urlS.replace(" ", "%20");
            final URI uri = new URI(urlS);
            return new URL(uri.toASCIIString());
        } catch (URISyntaxException | MalformedURLException e) {
            // give up and return the original input
            return u;
        }
    }

```

The code fails the following test:
```java
    @Test public void encodeUrl() throws MalformedURLException {
        URL url1 = new URL("https://test.com/foo bar/[One]?q=white space#frag");
        URL url2 = HttpConnection.encodeUrl(url1);
        assertEquals("https://test.com/foo%20bar/%5BOne%5D?q=white%20space#frag", url2.toExternalForm());
    }

```

With the following test error:
```
expected: <https://test.com/foo%20bar/%5BOne%5D?q=white%20space#frag> but was: <https://test.com/foo bar/[One]?q=white space#frag>
```

Please provide a fixed version of the buggy function, and only that function:
