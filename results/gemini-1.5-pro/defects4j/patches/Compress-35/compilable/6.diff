      * Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(file_format)#File_header">says</a>:
      * <blockquote>
      * The checksum is calculated by taking the sum of the unsigned byte values
      * of the header block with the eight checksum bytes taken to be ascii
      * spaces (decimal value 32). It is stored as a six digit octal number with
      * leading zeroes followed by a NUL and then a space. Various
      * implementations do not adhere to this format. For better compatibility,
      * ignore leading and trailing whitespace, and get the first six digits. In
      * addition, some historic tar implementations treated bytes as signed.
      * Implementations typically calculate the checksum both ways, and treat it
      * as good if either the signed or unsigned sum matches the included
      * checksum.
      * </blockquote>
      * <p>
      * The return value of this method should be treated as a best-effort
      * heuristic rather than an absolute and final truth. The checksum
      * verification logic may well evolve over time as more special cases
      * are encountered.
      *
      * @param header tar header
      * @return whether the checksum is reasonably good
      * @see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COMPRESS-191">COMPRESS-191</a>
