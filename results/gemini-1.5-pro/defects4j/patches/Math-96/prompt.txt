You are an automatic program repair tool. Your task is to fix the provided buggy code.

The following code contains a buggy function:
```java
    /**
     * Test for the equality of two Complex objects.
     * <p>
     * If both the real and imaginary parts of two Complex numbers
     * are exactly the same, and neither is <code>Double.NaN</code>, the two
     * Complex objects are considered to be equal.</p>
     * <p>
     * All <code>NaN</code> values are considered to be equal - i.e, if either
     * (or both) real and imaginary parts of the complex number are equal
     * to <code>Double.NaN</code>, the complex number is equal to 
     * <code>Complex.NaN</code>.</p>
     *
     * @param other Object to test for equality to this
     * @return true if two Complex objects are equal, false if
     *         object is null, not an instance of Complex, or
     *         not equal to this Complex instance
     * 
     */
    public boolean equals(Object other) {
        boolean ret;
        
        if (this == other) { 
            ret = true;
        } else if (other == null) {
            ret = false;
        } else  {
            try {
                Complex rhs = (Complex)other;
                if (rhs.isNaN()) {
                    ret = this.isNaN();
                } else {
                    ret = (Double.doubleToRawLongBits(real) == Double.doubleToRawLongBits(rhs.getReal())) && (Double.doubleToRawLongBits(imaginary) == Double.doubleToRawLongBits(rhs.getImaginary()));
                }
            } catch (ClassCastException ex) {
                // ignore exception
                ret = false;
            }
        }
      
        return ret;
    }

```

The code fails the following tests.

Test `org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexTest::testMath221`:
```java
    /** test issue MATH-221 */
    public void testMath221() {
        assertEquals(new Complex(0,-1), new Complex(0,1).multiply(new Complex(-1,0)));
    }

```
Test `org.apache.commons.math.complex.ComplexTest::testMath221` error:
```

```


Please provide a fixed version of the buggy function, and only that function, inside a code block.
