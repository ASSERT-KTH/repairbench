+// The buggy function is not provided, but based on the test case and error message,
+// it seems that the issue is related to the serialization of the 'Sub' class.
+// The 'Sub' class likely extends the 'Base' class and the serialization is not including the properties from 'Base'.
+
+public class Sub extends Base {
+    // Assuming the 'Sub' class has a property 'sub'
+    public int sub = 2;
+    
+    // The fix involves ensuring that the properties from 'Base' are properly included in the serialization.
+    // This can be achieved by adding the necessary annotations or modifying the serialization logic.
+    
+    // For example, if using Jackson, you can use the '@JsonProperty' annotation on the getters or fields in 'Base' class.
+    // Alternatively, you can configure the ObjectMapper to include the properties from the superclass.
+}
+
+// The 'Base' class is assumed to be defined as follows:
+public class Base {
+    public int base = 1;
