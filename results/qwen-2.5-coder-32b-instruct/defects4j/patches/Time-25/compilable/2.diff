 /**
  * Gets the millisecond offset to subtract from local time to get UTC time.
  * This offset can be used to undo adding the offset obtained by getOffset.
  *
  * <pre>
  * millisLocal == millisUTC   + getOffset(millisUTC)
  * millisUTC   == millisLocal - getOffsetFromLocal(millisLocal)
  * </pre>
  *
  * NOTE: After calculating millisLocal, some error may be introduced. At
  * offset transitions (due to DST or other historical changes), ranges of
  * local times may map to different UTC times.
  * <p>
  * This method will return an offset suitable for calculating an instant
  * after any DST gap. For example, consider a zone with a cutover
  * from 01:00 to 01:59:<br />
  * Input: 00:00  Output: 00:00<br />
  * Input: 00:30  Output: 00:30<br />
  * Input: 01:00  Output: 02:00<br />
  * Input: 01:30  Output: 02:30<br />
  * Input: 02:00  Output: 02:00<br />
  * Input: 02:30  Output: 02:30<br />
  * <p>
  * During a DST overlap (where the local time is ambiguous) this method will return
  * the earlier instant. The combination of these two rules is to always favour
  * daylight (summer) time over standard (winter) time.
  * <p>
  * NOTE: Prior to v2.0, the DST overlap behaviour was not defined and varied by hemisphere.
  * Prior to v1.5, the DST gap behaviour was also not defined.
  *
  * @param instantLocal  the millisecond instant, relative to this time zone, to get the offset for
  * @return the millisecond offset to subtract from local time to get UTC time
