+// Since you didn't provide the code, here's the common cause and solution for this Jackson serialization issue:
+
+// The problem is likely that the 'base' field is not properly annotated or accessible.
+// For fields in a base class to be serialized, they need to be accessible (public) or have getters,
+// or be annotated with @JsonProperty.
+
+// Suppose Base is:
+public static class Base {
+    // buggy: int base = 1;
+    // fix: make it public or provide getter or annotate:
+    @com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty
+    public int base = 1;
+}
+
+// OR (if you cannot change the field to public or add annotation, add a getter:)
+public static class Base {
+    private int base = 1;
+    public int getBase() {
+        return base;
+    }
+}
+
+// The same for Sub if needed:
+public static class Sub extends Base {
+    @com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty
+    public int sub = 2;
+}
+
+// Only the fixed Base class as the function:
+public static class Base {
+    @com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty
+    public int base = 1;
+}
