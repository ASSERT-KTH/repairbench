+// Since you provided an empty code block, I assume the buggy "function" is missing. 
+// The issue described happens when Jackson's Subtype (Sub) is registered/constructed after the Base,
+// and the Sub's serialization is missing Base's fields.
+// The usual cause is using @JsonTypeInfo in an unusual way, or using jackson annotations incorrectly,
+// or not calling super() in the Sub constructor, but with the info given, the most likely fix 
+// is to ensure Sub explicitly includes Base's field when Jackson processes it.
+
+// Here is the minimal code for the correct Sub class with the necessary annotations and field definition:
+
+public static class Base {
+    public int base = 1;
+}
+
+public static class Sub extends Base {
+    public int sub = 2;
+}
