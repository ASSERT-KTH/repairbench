+// There is no buggy function provided in the code snippet. 
+// However, based on the test failure, the likely issue is that the 'Sub' class is missing a field (or getter) for 'base', which is declared in the 'Base' class.
+// Below is a likely correct implementation of the 'Base' and 'Sub' classes:
+
+public static class Base {
+    public int base = 1;
+}
+
+public static class Sub extends Base {
+    public int sub = 2;
