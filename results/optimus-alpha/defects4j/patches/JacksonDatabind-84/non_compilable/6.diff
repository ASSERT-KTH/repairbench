+// It appears the code is missing. However, based on the failing test and description,
+// the problem is likely with the definition of the Base and Sub classes.
+// Here is a likely fixed version of those classes:
+
+static class Base {
+    public int base = 1;
+}
+
+static class Sub extends Base {
+    public int sub = 2;
+}

+// If the bug is elsewhere (such as missing annotations or fields being private), 
+// ensure the properties are public and match the test's expected output.
