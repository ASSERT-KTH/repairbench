+// As no function is shown in the input, it's likely the error is caused by the way the `Base` class's field is defined or used.
+// Typically, missing properties when serializing a subclass means the superclass fields are not visible to Jackson (e.g., not public, or missing getters).
+
+// Example fix: Ensure that the `Base` class's "base" field is public or has a public getter.
