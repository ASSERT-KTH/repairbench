+// There is no buggy function provided in the code. 
+// However, based on the test description and the error message,
+// the likely issue is within how Sub class is defined. 
+// The Sub class must declare a "base" property or call super constructor.
+// Here's the corrected Sub class:
+
+public static class Sub extends Base {
+    public int sub = 2;
+    public Sub() {
+        super(); // Ensure base=1 is inherited properly
