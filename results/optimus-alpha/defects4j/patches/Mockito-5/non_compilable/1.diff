      * Verify the given ongoing verification data, and confirm that it satisfies the delegate verification mode
      * before the full duration has passed.
      *
      * In practice, this polls the delegate verification mode until it is satisfied. If it is not satisfied once
      * the full duration has passed, the last error returned by the delegate verification mode will be thrown
      * here in turn. This may be thrown early if the delegate is unsatisfied and the verification mode is known
      * to never recover from this situation (e.g. {@link AtMost}).
      *
      * If it is satisfied before the full duration has passed, behaviour is dependent on the returnOnSuccess parameter
      * given in the constructor. If true, this verification mode is immediately satisfied once the delegate is. If
      * false, this verification mode is not satisfied until the delegate is satisfied and the full time has passed.
      *
      * @throws MockitoAssertionError if the delegate verification mode does not succeed before the timeout
