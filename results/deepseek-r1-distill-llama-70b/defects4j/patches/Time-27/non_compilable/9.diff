+Okay, so I need to fix this Java function that's causing a test failure. The test is `testBug2495455` in the `TestPeriodFormatterBuilder` class. The error message says that "PT1003199059S" is malformed at "1003199059S". That suggests that the parser isn't handling the format correctly, probably because the PeriodFormatter isn't being built properly.
+
+Looking at the `toFormatter` function, it's supposed to create a PeriodFormatter from a list of element pairs. The function starts by checking if neither printer nor parser is created, which throws an exception. Then, it looks at the size of the elementPairs list. If the size is at least 2 and the first element is a Separator, it tries to create a formatter by taking a subList starting from index 2. This probably skips some necessary elements because the sublist starts too far ahead. That would mean that parts of the format, like the literal 'T' in the test case, are being ignored, leading to the parser not expecting the following digits and letters correctly.
+
+So, the problem is in the way the subList is created when handling a Separator. Instead of starting from index 2, it should probably take the subList correctly so that all necessary components are included. Maybe the code should use `size - 1` as the end index.
+
+Let me think about how the original code works. The `toFormatter` function is supposed to build a PeriodFormatter by processing the elements in the elementPairs list. When the first element is a Separator, it takes a subList from index 2 to size, which skips the first separator and the next element, possibly the separator's content. But that might not correctly link the printer and parser for the nested elements.
+
+I should adjust the subList indices to ensure that only the first element (Separator) is removed, and the rest are processed correctly. So, instead of `elementPairs.subList(2, size)`, it should just take `elementPairs.subList(1, size)`. This way, the separator after the initial one is included in the formatter creation.
+
+So, in the code, the line:
\ No newline at end of file
