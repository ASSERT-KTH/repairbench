+// Or within _writeFieldName, the condition determines whether to add quotes.
+
+Alternatively, the functions that write field names should check the current configuration and apply quotes accordingly.
+
+I think the key is that the write methods are not correctly respecting the QUOTE_FIELD_NAMES feature, causing the test to fail.
+The issue arises because the `QUOTE_FIELD_NAMES` feature isn't correctly applied when generating field names. To fix this, ensure that field names are properly quoted based on the feature configuration.
