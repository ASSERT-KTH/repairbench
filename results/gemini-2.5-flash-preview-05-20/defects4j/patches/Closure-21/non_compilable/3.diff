+            For `n = x == bar()`: `parent` is `IF`. `parent.getType()` is `Token.IF`, which is not `EXPR_RESULT` or `BLOCK`. So, the `else if` block is entered.
+            The inner `if` condition `! (parent.getType() == Token.FOR ...)` is `true` (since `parent` is `IF`, not `FOR`).
+            This causes the `return;` at line 67 to be executed. This return prevents the code from reaching the final check that would report the useless code.
+            Therefore, removing this `return;` will allow `x == bar()` to proceed to the final check. Since `x == bar()` is a simple operator (`EQ`), `isSimpleOp` will be `true`, causing the warning to be reported. This fixes this test case.

+2.  **`test("function x(){}\nfunction f(a, b){}\nf(1,(2, 3));", "function x(){}\nfunction f(a, b){}\nf(1,(JSCOMPILER_PRESERVE(2), 3));", e);`**
+    *   Input: `f(1,(2, 3));`
+    *   Expected: A warning for `2` (the `NUMBER` literal).
+    *   Current behavior: No warning.
+    *   Analysis: When `n` is `2` (the `NUMBER` node), its `parent` is the `COMMA` node `(2,3)`.
+        *   `isResultUsed` (for `n=2`) is calculated using `NodeUtil.isExpressionResultUsed(n)`. For `COMMA` parents, `NodeUtil.isExpressionResultUsed` returns `true` only if `n` is the `parent.getLastChild()`. Since `2` is not the last child of `(2,3)` (which is `3`), `isResultUsed` will be `false`.
+        *   The code then enters `if (parent.getType() == Token.COMMA)` block.
+        *   `if (isResultUsed)` (which is `false`) is skipped.
+        *   `if (n == parent.getLastChild())` (which is `false`) is skipped.
+        *   The code then proceeds *past* the `COMMA` block without returning.
+        *   The `else if (parent.getType() != Token.EXPR_RESULT ...)` block (lines 64-68) is skipped because `parent.getType()` IS `Token.COMMA`.
+        *   Finally, the code reaches the last `if` block: `if ((isSimpleOp || !NodeUtil.mayHaveSideEffects(n, t.getCompiler())))`.
+        *   For `n=2` (a `NUMBER` literal), `isSimpleOp` is `false`, and `NodeUtil.mayHaveSideEffects(n)` is `false`. Therefore, `!NodeUtil.mayHaveSideEffects(n)` is `true`.
+        *   The condition `(false || true)` evaluates to `true`.
+        *   This means, theoretically, the error *should* be reported.
+        *   The fact that the test fails (expected 1 warning, got 0) implies that an early `return` is occurring somewhere, or `NodeUtil` methods are behaving unexpectedly. Given the problem asks to fix the provided buggy code, and without modifying `NodeUtil`, the only possible conclusion is that the logic for `COMMA` children is subtly incorrect in conjunction with how `NodeUtil` methods are implicitly used.
+        *   A common fix for this type of bug, observed in other Closure Compiler versions, is to make `isResultUsed` (for the immediate node `n`) irrelevant if the parent is `COMMA` and the *entire COMMA expression* is used. The original `isResultUsed` for `n` was `false`, but the comma `(2,3)` itself is used (as a `CALL` argument).
+
+The fixed code should remove the unnecessary `return;` at line 67 and adjust the `COMMA` handling to account for the usage of the overall comma expression.
+
+**Fixed logic for COMMA:**
+If `parent` is `COMMA`:
+*   Check if `commaResultUsed = NodeUtil.isExpressionResultUsed(parent)`.
+*   If `commaResultUsed` is `true`:
+    *   If `n` is the last child of `COMMA`, its result is used, so return. (This was covered by original `if (isResultUsed)` and the `n == parent.getLastChild()` block).
+    *   If `n` is *not* the last child (e.g. `2` in `(2,3)`), its value is discarded, but the overall `COMMA` expression is used. The test suggests that in this scenario, the intermediate `n` should *still* be reported as useless (as it has no side-effects and its value is discarded). My previous reasoning was incorrect - the test output `JSCOMPILER_PRESERVE(2)` indicates that `2` *is* considered useless.
+
+    The contradiction remains. The provided code *should* be failing by reporting the error for `2`. Yet the test says it got 0 warnings. This is a very deep inconsistency. Given the constraints, I will only apply the fix for the `x==bar()` case, as that bug is logically clear from the provided code structure.
+
+The most direct and certain fix based on the logical analysis of the provided code and test failures is to remove the `return;` at line 67. The issue with `f(1,(2,3))` must stem from a deeper interaction not visible within this single function.
