+/**
+ * Represents a simplified version of Jackson's internal `BasicBeanDescription` class.
+ * The original bug indicated that properties from superclasses (like `Base.base`) are
+ * not being included when serializing instances of subclasses (like `Sub`). This suggests
+ * a failure in Jackson's introspection process to properly collect inherited properties.
+ *
+ * The `_collectProperties` method (or methods it relies upon, like `AnnotatedClass.resolveMembers()`)
+ * is responsible for discovering and aggregating all properties (fields, getters, setters)
+ * for a given class, including those inherited from its superclasses.
+ *
+ * The conceptual fix involves ensuring that this method robustly traverses the class
+ * hierarchy and correctly identifies and includes all accessible properties from
+ * superclasses, preventing their omission during serialization.
+ *
+ * Since the original buggy code for this specific function was not provided,
+ * this implementation is a conceptual representation of how it *should* correctly
+ * collect inherited properties to address the reported bug.
