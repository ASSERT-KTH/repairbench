+    `getOffset(long instant)` takes a UTC instant. The initial `getOffset(instantLocal)` treats `instantLocal` (which is a local time) as if it were a UTC time to make a first estimate of the offset. `instantAdjusted` then becomes a more accurate UTC time. `offsetAdjusted` is the offset at this `instantAdjusted` UTC time.
+
+2.  **Handling Overlaps (Ambiguous Times):**
+    The problematic section for the London test is:
+    ```java
+    } else if (offsetLocal > 0) { // <-- PROBLEM 1: This condition is too restrictive.
         long prev = previousTransition(instantAdjusted);
         if (prev < instantAdjusted) {
-                int offsetPrev = getOffset(prev);
+            int offsetPrev = getOffset(prev); // <-- PROBLEM 2: This gets offset *after* transition.
             int diff = offsetPrev - offsetLocal;
             if (instantAdjusted - prev <= diff) {
                 return offsetPrev;
             }
         }
     }
-        return offsetAdjusted;
+    ```
+    *   **Problem 1 (`offsetLocal > 0`):** For zones like London where the standard offset is +00:00 (GMT), `offsetLocal` can often be 0. This condition prevents the overlap handling logic from being executed for such zones, causing the failure in the London test. This condition should be removed or changed to `offsetLocal == offsetAdjusted` (as this branch is only reached when `offsetLocal` equals `offsetAdjusted`).
+    *   **Problem 2 (`getOffset(prev)`):** When `getOffset(long instant)` is called with an `instant` that is exactly a transition point (`prev` is a transition point), Joda-Time's internal logic often returns the offset *after* that transition. However, to determine an overlap, we need the offset *before* the transition (`offsetPrevBefore`) to calculate the correct `diff` (duration of the overlap). `getOffset(prev - 1)` is the correct way to get the offset just before `prev`.
+
+    **Fix for Overlaps:**
+    *   Change `else if (offsetLocal > 0)` to `else if (offsetLocal == offsetAdjusted)`. This ensures the overlap logic is applied when `offsetLocal` and `offsetAdjusted` agree (indicating no gap and potentially an overlap, or no transition nearby).
+    *   Change `int offsetPrev = getOffset(prev);` to `int offsetPrev = getOffset(prev - 1);`. This correctly retrieves the offset *before* the previous transition. With this change, `diff = offsetPrev - offsetLocal` (which becomes `offsetBeforeTransition - offsetAfterTransition`) correctly represents the duration of the overlap. The `if (instantAdjusted - prev <= diff)` condition then correctly checks if `instantAdjusted` falls within this ambiguous period, and `return offsetPrev` (now `offsetBeforeTransition`) correctly applies the "favour daylight time" rule.
+
+3.  **Handling Gaps (Skipped Times):**
+    The relevant section is:
+    ```java
+    if ((offsetLocal - offsetAdjusted) < 0) {
+        // ...
+        if (nextLocal != nextAdjusted) {
+            return offsetLocal; // <-- POTENTIAL PROBLEM 3: Returns offset *before* gap.
         }
+    }
+    ```
+    When `(offsetLocal - offsetAdjusted) < 0`, it implies `offsetLocal < offsetAdjusted`, which means the offset increased (e.g., from +00:00 to +01:00). This corresponds to a DST "spring forward" or a gap. The Javadoc states: "This method will return an offset suitable for calculating an instant after any DST gap." If `instantLocal` falls into a gap, the logical choice for the offset is `offsetAdjusted` (the offset *after* the gap), as this maps the local time to a UTC time that is *after* the gap. Returning `offsetLocal` (the offset *before* the gap) would map the local time to a UTC time that is *before* the gap, contradicting the Javadoc's intent.
+
+    **Fix for Gaps:**
+    *   Change `return offsetLocal;` to `return offsetAdjusted;` within the `if ((offsetLocal - offsetAdjusted) < 0)` block.
