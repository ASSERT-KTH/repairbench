+2.  **Failing Test Scenario:** In `verify(mockTwo).simpleMethod(mock.otherMethod())`, `mock.otherMethod()` is invoked.
+    *   This call is not intended to start a *new* stubbing chain (like `when(mock.otherMethod())`). Its purpose is to resolve the argument for `simpleMethod`.
+    *   Since `when(mock.otherMethod()).thenReturn("foo")` was already executed, `invocationContainerImpl.hasAnswersForStubbing()` (which checks for an *ongoing* stubbing setup within *this mock's container*) is `false`.
+    *   `mockingProgress.pullVerificationMode()` is `null` because `verify` is targeting `mockTwo`, not `mock`.
+    *   Thus, the execution falls into the "general invocation" path where `mockingProgress.reportOngoingStubbing(ongoingStubbing);` is called.
+3.  **Consequence:** Calling `mockingProgress.reportOngoingStubbing()` in this context incorrectly sets a global Mockito state indicating that an ongoing stubbing is being set up for `mock`. This can interfere with subsequent verification calls and overall Mockito state. The test `shouldAllowVerifyingWhenOtherMockCallIsInTheSameLine` fails because the `never()` verification doesn't behave as expected, likely due to this corrupted `mockingProgress` state.
 
-        StubbedInvocationMatcher stubbedInvocation = invocationContainerImpl.findAnswerFor(invocation);
+**Root Cause:**
+The `mockingProgress.reportOngoingStubbing()` call, and the creation of `OngoingStubbingImpl`, should only occur when Mockito is explicitly in the process of setting up a new stubbing chain (i.e., immediately after `Mockito.when()` has been called).
 
-        if (stubbedInvocation != null) {
-            stubbedInvocation.captureArgumentsFrom(invocation);
-            return stubbedInvocation.answer(invocation);
-        } else {
-            Object ret = mockSettings.getDefaultAnswer().answer(invocation);
+**Fix:**
 
-            // redo setting invocation for potential stubbing in case of partial
-            // mocks / spies.
-            // Without it, the real method inside 'when' might have delegated
-            // to other self method and overwrite the intended stubbed method
-            // with a different one. The reset is required to avoid runtime exception that validates return type with stubbed method signature.
-            invocationContainerImpl.resetInvocationForPotentialStubbing(invocationMatcher);
-            return ret;
-        }
-    }
+1.  **Refine Stubbing Setup Condition:** The initial `if` statement for stubbing setup needs to use the global `mockingProgress.hasOngoingStubbing()` flag, which correctly indicates if `Mockito.when()` was just invoked and an ongoing stubbing is expected. The previous `invocationContainerImpl.hasAnswersForStubbing()` was local to the mock's container and could be `false` even when a global `when` operation was in progress.
+2.  **Remove Misplaced `reportOngoingStubbing`:** The lines responsible for creating `OngoingStubbingImpl` and calling `mockingProgress.reportOngoingStubbing()` should be removed from the general invocation path (after `if (verificationMode != null)`). These operations are only relevant during the explicit setup of a `when().thenReturn()` (or similar) chain.
