+// It seems the relevant buggy code is missing. 
+// However, based on the test failure, the likely issue is in the 'Sub' class definition, 
+// where 'base' property from 'Base' is not being serialized because it is not defined as a field, 
+// or lacks a getter, or @JsonProperty annotation is missing.
+
+// The fix is to ensure that Base's 'base' property is correctly visible to Jackson via getter.
+// Assuming this is the Base and Sub class:
+
+public static class Base {
+    private int base = 1;
+
+    public int getBase() {
+        return base;
+    }
+}
+
+public static class Sub extends Base {
+    private int sub = 2;
+
+    public int getSub() {
+        return sub;
+    }
+}
