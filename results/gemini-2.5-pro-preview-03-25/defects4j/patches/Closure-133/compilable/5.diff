+    // but rather in how the caller uses the stream's position information *after*
+    // this function is called (which advances the stream's internal pointer).
+    // Common issues involve marking a start position, calling this method to skip
+    // ahead (potentially across lines), and then creating a node using the old
+    // start position and the new stream position as the end position, leading
+    // to inconsistent position data (e.g., end offset < start offset if line/char
+    // handling is complex).
+    // However, adhering to the request to provide a fix *for this function*,
+    // and acknowledging that subtle stream interactions can sometimes cause issues,
+    // the simplest form (pure delegation) is presented, assuming the underlying
+    // stream method correctly updates its state. If the stream method itself
+    // has a bug (e.g., not consuming newline or updating position incorrectly),
+    // that bug cannot be fixed solely within this wrapper without knowledge of
+    // stream internals or changing the stream implementation. Historical fixes
+    // for similar issues involved modifying the *callers* of this function.
