      * <p>
      * Decodes all of the provided data, starting at inPos, for inAvail bytes. Should be called at least twice: once
      * with the data to decode, and once with inAvail set to "-1" to alert decoder that EOF has been reached. The "-1"
      * call is not necessary when decoding, but it doesn't hurt, either.
      * </p>
      * <p>
      * Ignores all non-base64 characters. This is how chunked (e.g. 76 character) data is handled, since CR and LF are
      * silently ignored, but has implications for other bytes, too. This method subscribes to the garbage-in,
      * garbage-out philosophy: it will not check the provided data for validity.
      * </p>
      * <p>
      * Thanks to "commons" project in ws.apache.org for the bitwise operations, and general approach.
