      * a value type deserializer; this caused an issue with 2.4.4 of
      * JAXB Annotations (failing a test).
      * It is also possible that some other settings could make deserializers
      * un-cacheable; but on the other hand, caching can make a big positive
      * difference with performance... so it's a hard choice.
