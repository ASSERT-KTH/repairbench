      * Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(file_format)#File_header">says</a>:
      * <blockquote>
      * The checksum is calculated by taking the sum of the unsigned byte values
      * of the header block with the eight checksum bytes taken to be ascii
      * spaces (decimal value 32). It is stored as a six digit octal number with
      * leading zeroes followed by a NUL and then a space. Various
      * implementations do not adhere to this format. For better compatibility,
      * ignore leading and trailing whitespace, and get the first six digits. In
      * addition, some historic tar implementations treated bytes as signed.
      * Implementations typically calculate the checksum both ways, and treat it
      * as good if either the signed or unsigned sum matches the included
      * checksum.
      * </blockquote>
      * <p>
+     * Some TAR archives, particularly those produced by GNU tar, may contain
+     * negative values in the checksum field (using binary numbers) as used by
+     * the GNU tar {@code --incremental} option. This is documented in the
+     * <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Standard.html">GNU Tar Standard</a>.
+     * Such archives are expected to have the high bit set in the first byte of
+     * the checksum field (byte 148). Handling such archives requires parsing
+     * the checksum field as a binary number, which this method does not currently
+     * do. As a workaround for COMPRESS-335, we accept headers with the high bit
+     * set in the first checksum byte, assuming they are valid GNU incremental
+     * headers, without actually verifying the checksum. A more complete solution
+     * would involve parsing the binary checksum.
+     * </p>
+     * <p>
      * The return value of this method should be treated as a best-effort
      * heuristic rather than an absolute and final truth. The checksum
      * verification logic may well evolve over time as more special cases
      * are encountered.
      *
