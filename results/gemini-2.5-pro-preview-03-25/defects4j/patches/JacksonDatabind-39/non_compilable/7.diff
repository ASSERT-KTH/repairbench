-        //    special unfortunately
-            p.skipChildren();
+        //    special unfortunately -- suggests skipping was intended here.
+        // Test failure (UnrecognizedPropertyException) indicates skipping did not happen correctly.
+        // The BeanDeserializer processed fields ('location') that should have been skipped
+        // as part of the unrecognized polymorphic type ('item').
+        // This method is called when the type id is unknown and FAIL_ON_INVALID_SUBTYPE is false.
+        // We need to consume the rest of the JSON value associated with the type.
+
+        // It's likely we are inside a JSON Object (for As.PROPERTY style).
+        // The TypeDeserializer consumed the type id property, leaving the parser
+        // positioned after the type id's value. We need to consume remaining
+        // properties until the END_OBJECT matching the start of the value object.
+        // The most robust way is to simply skip the entire value structure,
+        // regardless of the current token, using p.skipValue().
+        // NOTE: p.skipChildren() only works if current token is START_OBJECT/ARRAY.
+        // p.skipValue() works for any token and skips the corresponding value structure.
+        // If current token is FIELD_NAME, skips the name and the following value.
+        // If current token is START_OBJECT/ARRAY, skips the whole structure.
+        // If current token is a scalar value, skips just that value.
+
+        // Let's assume the TypeDeserializer leaves the parser positioned such that
+        // the "value" to be skipped is the logical next structure. In the case of
+        // As.PROPERTY like { "type": "unknown", "location": "loc1" }, after reading
+        // "unknown", the TypeDeserializer might not advance the parser further.
+        // Calling skipValue() on the VALUE_STRING "unknown" would be wrong.
+        // The TypeDeserializer *should* handle advancing/skipping.
+
+        // HOWEVER, if the contract *is* that this deserializer must skip, then the original
+        // skipChildren() was wrong. A loop consuming tokens might work, but is complex.
+        // Let's reconsider the TypeDeserializer contract. Jackson 2.7+ (post comment date)
+        // improved TypeDeserializer skipping logic (see databind#2546, #2733).
+        // It's highly likely the TypeDeserializer *should* call p.skipValue() *after*
+        // this handler returns null. If so, this method should simply return null.
+
+        // Given the original code *tried* to skip, let's attempt the most robust skip possible
+        // within this method, covering the case where TypeDeserializer doesn't skip.
+        // We assume we're inside an object and need to reach the end.
+        // The loop `while (p.nextToken() != JsonToken.END_OBJECT) { p.skipValue(); }`
+        // seems appropriate if the parser is positioned right after the type id value.
+
+        // Let's test the simplest solution first, assuming the caller (TypeDeserializer) handles skipping.
+        // If `p.skipChildren()` was the only issue, just returning null might let the (potentially updated)
+        // TypeDeserializer logic work correctly.
+        // The original comment might refer to issues in older Jackson versions.
+
+        // Correction: The original code `p.skipChildren()` implies this method *should* skip.
+        // The failure indicates it didn't skip correctly.
+        // The robust way to skip the *remainder* of an object when positioned inside it
+        // (after the type property) is to consume tokens until the corresponding END_OBJECT.
+        // Using JsonParser#skipChildren logic adapted for starting inside:
+        if (p.isExpectedStartObjectToken()) { // Should not happen if type property was already consumed
+             p.skipChildren(); // But if it does, skip children
+        } else {
+             // Assume we are inside the object, after the type property.
+             // Consume tokens until we hit the END_OBJECT for this level.
+             while (p.nextToken() != JsonToken.END_OBJECT) {
+                 // For each token encountered (could be FIELD_NAME, START_OBJECT, scalar),
+                 // skip its corresponding value structure.
+                 p.skipValue();
+             }
