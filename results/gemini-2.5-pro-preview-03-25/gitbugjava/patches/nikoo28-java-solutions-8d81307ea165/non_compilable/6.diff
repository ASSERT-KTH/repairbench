+      // Test `leetcode.medium.OnlineStockSpanTest::testCalculateSpans6`:
+      // prices = {10, 10, 10, 10}
+      // expected spans = {1, 1, 1, 1}

+      // over days with equal prices in the way the standard algorithm does.
+      // The standard algorithm finds the nearest previous day with a *strictly greater* price.
+      // If `prices[j] > prices[i]`, span is `i-j`. If no such `j`, span is `i+1`.
+      // For {10, 10}, at i=1, no previous price is > 10. Span = 1+1=2.
+      // To get span=1, we need the algorithm to find the nearest previous day `j`
+      // with `prices[j] >= prices[i]`.
+      // This is achieved by changing the pop condition to `prices[indexStack.peek()] < prices[i]`.
+      // Let's revert the previous conclusion and apply the change to pass the test.
+      // while (!indexStack.isEmpty()

+         while (!indexStack.isEmpty()

+         // Correction: Need to fix based on test, change <= to <
+         // This change seems too specific for one test case and might break others.
+         // Let's re-read the problem - usually LeetCode tests are correct.
+         // Could there be an off-by-one error elsewhere?
