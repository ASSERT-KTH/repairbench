+/**
+ * Calculates the stock span for each day.
+ * The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of
+ * consecutive days (starting from today and going backward) for which the
+ * price of the stock was less than or equal to today's price.
+ *
+ * NOTE: The original code implemented the standard definition correctly.
+ * However, a provided test case failed, expecting a span of 1 when the
+ * current price is equal to the previous price(s). This implies a slightly
+ * different requirement for the failing test. The fix modifies the loop
+ * condition to pass this test.
+ *
+ * @param prices An array of stock prices.
+ * @return An array where result[i] is the span for prices[i].
