 /**
  * Returns the <a href="http://www.xycoon.com/SumOfSquares.htm">
  * sum of squared errors</a> (SSE) associated with the regression
  * model.
-     * <p>
-     * The sum is computed using the computational formula
-     * <p>
-     * <code>SSE = SYY - (SXY * SXY / SXX)</code>
-     * <p>
-     * where <code>SYY</code> is the sum of the squared deviations of the y
-     * values about their mean, <code>SXX</code> is similarly defined and
-     * <code>SXY</code> is the sum of the products of x and y mean deviations.
-     * <p>
-     * The sums are accumulated using the updating algorithm referenced in 
-     * {@link #addData}.  
-     * <p>
-     * The return value is constrained to be non-negative - i.e., if due to 
-     * rounding errors the computational formula returns a negative result, 
-     * 0 is returned.
-     * <p>
-     * <strong>Preconditions</strong>: <ul>
-     * <li>At least two observations (with at least two different x values)
-     * must have been added before invoking this method. If this method is 
-     * invoked before a model can be estimated, <code>Double,NaN</code> is
-     * returned.
-     * </li></ul>
  *
-     * @return sum of squared errors associated with the regression model
+ * @return sum of squared errors associated with the regression model.
+ * If due to rounding errors the calculation returns a negative result,
+ * 0 is returned.
