      * Normalizes this period using standard rules, assuming a 12 month year,
      * 7 day week, 24 hour day, 60 minute hour and 60 second minute,
      * providing control over how the result is split into fields.
      * <p>
      * This method allows you to normalize a period.
      * However to achieve this it makes the assumption that all years are
      * 12 months, all weeks are 7 days, all days are 24 hours,
      * all hours are 60 minutes and all minutes are 60 seconds. This is not
      * true when daylight savings time is considered, and may also not be true
      * for some chronologies. However, it is included as it is a useful operation
      * for many applications and business rules.
      * <p>
      * If the period contains years or months, then the months will be
      * normalized to be between 0 and 11. The days field and below will be
      * normalized as necessary, however this will not overflow into the months
      * field. Thus a period of 1 year 15 months will normalize to 2 years 3 months.
      * But a period of 1 month 40 days will remain as 1 month 40 days.
      * <p>
      * The PeriodType parameter controls how the result is created. It allows
      * you to omit certain fields from the result if desired. For example,
      * you may not want the result to include weeks, in which case you pass
      * in <code>PeriodType.yearMonthDayTime()</code>.
      * 
      * @param type  the period type of the new period, null means standard type
      * @return a normalized period equivalent to this period
      * @throws ArithmeticException if any field is too large to be represented
      * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if this period contains non-zero
      *  years or months but the specified period type does not support them
      * @since 1.5
