You are an automatic program repair tool. Your task is to fix the provided buggy code.

The following code contains a buggy function:
```java
    /**
     * Method called to expand size of the current segment, to
     * accommodate for more contiguous content. Usually only
     * used when parsing tokens like names if even then.
     */
    public char[] expandCurrentSegment()
    {
        final char[] curr = _currentSegment;
        // Let's grow by 50% by default
        final int len = curr.length;
        // but above intended maximum, slow to increase by 25%
        int newLen = (len == MAX_SEGMENT_LEN) ? (MAX_SEGMENT_LEN+1) : Math.min(MAX_SEGMENT_LEN, len + (len >> 1));
        return (_currentSegment = Arrays.copyOf(curr, newLen));
    }

```

The code fails the following tests.

Test `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.util.TestTextBuffer::testExpand`:
```java
      // [Core#152]
      public void testExpand()
      {
          TextBuffer tb = new TextBuffer(new BufferRecycler());
          char[] buf = tb.getCurrentSegment();

          while (buf.length < 500 * 1000) {
              char[] old = buf;
              buf = tb.expandCurrentSegment();
              if (old.length >= buf.length) {
                  fail("Expected buffer of "+old.length+" to expand, did not, length now "+buf.length);
              }
          }
      }

```
Test `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.util.TestTextBuffer::testExpand` error:
```
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Expected buffer of 262145 to expand, did not, length now 262144
```


Please provide a fixed version of the buggy function, and only that function, inside a code block.
