You are an automatic program repair tool. Your task is to fix the provided buggy code.

The following code contains a buggy function:
```java
    /**
     * Returns the <a href="http://www.xycoon.com/SumOfSquares.htm">
     * sum of squared errors</a> (SSE) associated with the regression 
     * model.
     * <p>
     * The sum is computed using the computational formula
     * <p>
     * <code>SSE = SYY - (SXY * SXY / SXX)</code>
     * <p>
     * where <code>SYY</code> is the sum of the squared deviations of the y
     * values about their mean, <code>SXX</code> is similarly defined and
     * <code>SXY</code> is the sum of the products of x and y mean deviations.
     * <p>
     * The sums are accumulated using the updating algorithm referenced in 
     * {@link #addData}.  
     * <p>
     * The return value is constrained to be non-negative - i.e., if due to 
     * rounding errors the computational formula returns a negative result, 
     * 0 is returned.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Preconditions</strong>: <ul>
     * <li>At least two observations (with at least two different x values)
     * must have been added before invoking this method. If this method is 
     * invoked before a model can be estimated, <code>Double,NaN</code> is
     * returned.
     * </li></ul>
     *
     * @return sum of squared errors associated with the regression model
     */
    public double getSumSquaredErrors() {
        return sumYY - sumXY * sumXY / sumXX;
    }

```

The code fails the following tests.

Test `org.apache.commons.math.stat.regression.SimpleRegressionTest::testSSENonNegative`:
```java
    // Jira MATH-85 = Bugzilla 39432
    public void testSSENonNegative() {
        double[] y = { 8915.102, 8919.302, 8923.502 };
        double[] x = { 1.107178495E2, 1.107264895E2, 1.107351295E2 };
        SimpleRegression reg = new SimpleRegression();
        for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
            reg.addData(x[i], y[i]);
        }
        assertTrue(reg.getSumSquaredErrors() >= 0.0);
    } 

```
Test `org.apache.commons.math.stat.regression.SimpleRegressionTest::testSSENonNegative` error:
```
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError
```


Please provide a fixed version of the buggy function, and only that function, inside a code block.
