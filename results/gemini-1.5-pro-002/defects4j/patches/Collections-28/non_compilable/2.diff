+
+The provided code snippet is empty.  The issue lies within the `PatriciaTrie` implementation itself, specifically how it handles the `clear()` operation on a `prefixMap`. The `prefixMap` view isn't properly reflecting changes back to the main trie. Unfortunately, without access to the original `PatriciaTrie` code, I cannot provide a direct fix.
+
+However, based on the error and the test case, the issue likely stems from the `prefixMap`'s `clear()` method not correctly removing the entries from the underlying trie. A possible solution involves iterating through the keys of the `prefixMap` and removing them individually from the trie within the `prefixMap.clear()` implementation.
+
+Here's a hypothetical example of how a fix might look within the `PatriciaTrie` class, assuming some internal methods and structure.  This is a **guess** without seeing the real code.
