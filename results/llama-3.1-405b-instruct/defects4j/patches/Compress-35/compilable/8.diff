 /**
  * Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(file_format)#File_header">says</a>:
  * <blockquote>
  * The checksum is calculated by taking the sum of the unsigned byte values
  * of the header block with the eight checksum bytes taken to be ascii
  * spaces (decimal value 32). It is stored as a six digit octal number with
  * leading zeroes followed by a NUL and then a space. Various
  * implementations do not adhere to this format. For better compatibility,
  * ignore leading and trailing whitespace, and get the first six digits. In
  * addition, some historic tar implementations treated bytes as signed.
  * Implementations typically calculate the checksum both ways, and treat it
  * as good if either the signed or unsigned sum matches the included
  * checksum.
  * </blockquote>
  * <p>
  * The return value of this method should be treated as a best-effort
  * heuristic rather than an absolute and final truth. The checksum
  * verification logic may well evolve over time as more special cases
  * are encountered.
  *
  * @param header tar header
  * @return whether the checksum is reasonably good
  * @see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COMPRESS-191">COMPRESS-191</a>
  * @since 1.5
