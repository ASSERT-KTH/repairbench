 /**
  * Returns the <a href="http://www.xycoon.com/SumOfSquares.htm">
  * sum of squared errors</a> (SSE) associated with the regression 
  * model.
  * <p>
  * The sum is computed using the computational formula
  * <p>
  * <code>SSE = SYY - (SXY * SXY / SXX)</code>
  * <p>
  * where <code>SYY</code> is the sum of the squared deviations of the y
  * values about their mean, <code>SXX</code> is similarly defined and
  * <code>SXY</code> is the sum of the products of x and y mean deviations.
  * <p>
  * The sums are accumulated using the updating algorithm referenced in 
  * {@link #addData}.  
  * <p>
  * The return value is constrained to be non-negative - i.e., if due to 
  * rounding errors the computational formula returns a negative result, 
  * 0 is returned.
  * <p>
  * <strong>Preconditions</strong>: <ul>
  * <li>At least two observations (with at least two different x values)
  * must have been added before invoking this method. If this method is 
  * invoked before a model can be estimated, <code>Double,NaN</code> is
  * returned.
  * </li></ul>
