+   This loop searches from the end of the buffer backward to find the last ']' character, indicating the end of a frame. Once found, `endIndex` is set to `i + 1`, which points just after the ']'.
+
+2. **Processing the frame:**
+
+   If `endIndex` is greater than 0, it means a frame delimiter was found, and the code proceeds to extract the frame.
+
+   ```java
    ByteBuf frame = Unpooled.buffer();
    while (buf.readerIndex() < endIndex) {

        if (b1 == '}') {

-                        case 0x04:
-                            frame.writeByte(',');
-                            break;
-                        case 0x05:
-                            frame.writeByte('*');
-                            break;
+               case 0x01: frame.writeByte('}'); break;
+               case 0x02: frame.writeByte('['); break;

+               case 0x04: frame.writeByte(','); break;
+               case 0x05: frame.writeByte('*'); break;
                default:
                    throw new IllegalArgumentException(String.format(
                            "unexpected byte at %d: 0x%02x", buf.readerIndex() - 1, b2));
            }
        } else {
            frame.writeByte(b1);
        }
    }
    return frame;
-        }
+   ```
 
-        return null;
-    }
+   Here, it reads bytes from the buffer until the `endIndex`. If it encounters a '}', it reads an additional byte and maps it to specific characters based on the value of `b2`. This seems like an escape mechanism where '}' is used to introduce special bytes.
+
+Now, looking at the test failures, it seems that the decoder is not correctly separating multiple frames in the buffer. For example, in the first test case, it expects a single frame but receives multiple frames concatenated together.
+
+Possible issues:
+
+- The decoder might be failing to handle multiple frames in a single buffer.
+
+- The way it finds the end index might not be correctly identifying the boundaries between frames.
+
+- There might be an issue with the escape sequences not being properly handled, leading to frames being misparsed.
+
+Let me consider how to fix this.
+
+First, I need to ensure that the decoder can handle multiple frames in a single buffer. Currently, it seems to find the first frame and extract it, but doesn't handle the remaining data in the buffer.
+
+One approach is to repeatedly search for ']' from the current readerIndex to the writerIndex, extract the frame up to that point, and then repeat the process with the remaining buffer.
+
+Additionally, I need to make sure that the escape sequences are correctly handled within each frame.
+
+Here's an idea for a revised approach:
+
+1. **Find all frame boundaries:**
+
+   - Search for all ']' characters in the buffer, keeping track of their positions.
+
+   - For each ']', check if the frame before it is valid, considering the escape sequences.
+
+2. **Extract each frame:**
+
+   - For each identified frame boundary, extract the frame from the start of the buffer to just after the ']'.
+
+   - Handle escape sequences within the frame.
+
+3. **Return the frames:**
+
+   - Return each extracted and processed frame.
+
+However, in the current method signature, it returns a single Object, which seems to be a single ByteBuf representing one frame. If multiple frames are present in the buffer, it might need to handle them appropriately, perhaps by decoding one frame at a time and leaving the rest in the buffer for subsequent calls.
+
+Alternatively, the method could return a list of frames if multiple are present, but the current method signature returns a single Object, which might need to be adjusted.
+
+Given that it's a ChannelHandler's decode method, it's common to return a list of decoded objects, but in this case, it's overridden to return a single Object. To handle multiple frames, it might make sense to adjust the method to return a List<Object>, but that would require changes beyond just this method.
+
+Considering time constraints, I'll aim to fix the current method to correctly handle at least single frames and potentially multiple frames if possible within the existing structure.
+
+Looking back at the failing test, it seems that the decoder is returning the entire buffer contents instead of just the first frame. This suggests that the frame boundary detection isn't stopping at the first frame.
+
+Possible solution:
+
+- Modify the loop to find the first ']' instead of the last ']'. This would allow extracting the first frame and leaving the rest in the buffer for later decoding.
+
+But, in the current implementation, it's searching from the end to the start, which would find the last ']', potentially capturing multiple frames in one go.
+
+I think switching to find the first ']' would be a better approach.
+
+Let me try rewriting the method accordingly.
+
+## Final Solution
+To fix the `decode` method, we need to ensure that it correctly identifies and extracts individual frames from the input buffer. Each frame is delimited by '[' and ']', and there's an escape mechanism involving '}' followed by specific bytes.
+
+### Approach
+1. **Find the End Index of the First Frame:**
+   - Search from the beginning to the end of the buffer to find the first ']' character, which indicates the end of a frame.
+   
+2. **Extract and Process the Frame:**
+   - Once the end index is found, extract the frame from the start of the buffer up to and including the ']' character.
+   - Handle the escape sequences within the frame where '}' is followed by special bytes that represent specific characters.
+
+3. **Return the Processed Frame:**
+   - Return the processed frame as a new `ByteBuf`.
