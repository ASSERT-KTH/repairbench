+    This constructor delegates to another constructor with a boolean parameter set to `false`. We need to ensure that this configuration matches the expected behavior for encoding and decoding.
+
+2. **Encoding and Decoding Modes**:
+    - The javadoc comments suggest that this constructor creates a Base64 codec for decoding all variants and encoding in URL-unsafe mode with no chunking.
+    - We need to verify that the encoding table and other properties are correctly set.
+
+3. **Test Failures**:
+    - Both `testEncoder` and `testBinaryEncoder` fail at test case 1, indicating a problem with the encoding output for a specific input.
+
+### Solution
+
+To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `Base64` constructor initializes the codec correctly, matching the behavior of the previous version. Here’s how we can approach this:
+
+1. **Check the Delegate Constructor**:
+    - Investigate what the `this(false)` constructor does and ensure that it sets the correct properties for encoding and decoding.
+
+2. **Verify Encoding Table**:
+    - Ensure that the encoding table used is `STANDARD_ENCODE_TABLE` as mentioned in the javadoc.
+
+3. **Line Length Configuration**:
+    - Confirm that the line length is set to 0 for no chunking.
+
+4. **Decoding Variants**:
+    - Ensure that the decoder can handle all variants of Base64 encoding.
+
+Given this, let's assume that the delegate constructor `this(false)` might not be setting all the required properties correctly. We need to explicitly set these properties in the no-argument constructor to match the expected behavior.
+
+### Fixed Code
+
+To fix the constructor, we can explicitly set the encoding table and line length in the no-argument constructor. Here’s the revised code:
