-        // Skip leading spaces
+   This checks if the first byte is NUL and returns 0 immediately. This is done to handle missing fields, but it might be too aggressive. Perhaps there are cases where a NUL byte is part of the octal string, and returning 0 isn't the correct behavior.
+
+2. **Skipping Leading Spaces:**
+
+   ```java
    while (start < end){
        if (buffer[start] == ' '){
            start++;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
+   ```
 
-        // Must have trailing NUL or space
+   This loop skips leading space bytes, which is correct.
+
+3. **Handling Trailing Bytes:**
+
+   ```java
    byte trailer;
    trailer = buffer[end-1];
    if (trailer == 0 || trailer == ' '){
        end--;
    } else {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                exceptionMessage(buffer, offset, length, end-1, trailer));
    }
-        // May have additional NULs or spaces
    trailer = buffer[end - 1];
    if (trailer == 0 || trailer == ' '){
        end--;
    }
+   ```
 
+   This part ensures that there's at least one trailing space or NUL byte and allows for an additional one. It adjusts the `end` index accordingly.
+
+4. **Parsing the Octal Digits:**
+
+   ```java
    for ( ;start < end; start++) {
        final byte currentByte = buffer[start];
-            // CheckStyle:MagicNumber OFF
        if (currentByte < '0' || currentByte > '7'){
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                    exceptionMessage(buffer, offset, length, start, currentByte));
        }
        result = (result << 3) + (currentByte - '0'); // convert from ASCII
-            // CheckStyle:MagicNumber ON
    }
+   ```
 
-        return result;
-    }
+   This loop iterates through the bytes between `start` and `end`, checks if each byte is a valid octal digit ('0' to '7'), and accumulates the result.
+
+Given that the test is failing, there must be some input that isn't being handled correctly. Let's consider possible edge cases:
+
+- **All NUL bytes:** The function returns 0, which seems correct.
+
+- **Leading NUL byte:** The function returns 0 immediately, which might not be desired if the NUL byte is not intended to represent a missing field.
+
+- **Trailing bytes missing:** The function throws an exception, which is correct.
+
+- **Invalid bytes in the octal string:** The function throws an exception, which is correct.
+
+Given that the test is failing with "Error detected parsing the header," it's possible that the input buffer has invalid bytes that are not being handled correctly.
+
+One potential issue is that the function treats a single leading NUL byte as a special case and returns 0 immediately. However, in some TAR archives, NUL bytes might be present within the header fields, and they may not necessarily indicate a missing field.
+
+Perhaps this behavior was introduced in Commons Compress 1.4 to handle some specific cases, but it's causing issues with certain TAR archives.
+
+Another possible issue is that the function requires at least two bytes, but in some cases, the buffer might have fewer bytes, although the length parameter should ensure that this doesn't happen.
+
+Looking back at the code, the check for minimum length is:
