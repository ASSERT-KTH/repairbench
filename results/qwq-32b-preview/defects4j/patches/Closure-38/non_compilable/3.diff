+   This part checks if the previous character is a minus sign and adds a space if `x` is negative. However, it seems that this logic is not sufficient for handling negative zero properly.
 
+2. **Handle integer values:**
+   ```java
    if ((long) x == x && !negativeZero) {
      long value = (long) x;
      long mantissa = value;
      int exp = 0;
      if (Math.abs(x) >= 100) {
        while (mantissa / 10 * Math.pow(10, exp + 1) == value) {
          mantissa /= 10;
          exp++;
        }
      }
      if (exp > 2) {
        add(Long.toString(mantissa) + "E" + Integer.toString(exp));
      } else {
        add(Long.toString(value));
      }
    } else {
      add(String.valueOf(x));
    }
-  }
+   ```
+   This part handles the formatting of integer values, potentially using scientific notation for large numbers, and falls back to `String.valueOf(x)` for other cases.
+
+**Problem Identification:**
+
+The test failure suggests that there is no space added between two minus signs in certain cases, leading to misparsing (e.g., `x--0.0` instead of `x- -0.0`).
+
+**Solution Approach:**
+
+We need to ensure that when `x` is negative, and the previous character is a minus sign, a space is added to separate them. Additionally, we need to handle negative zero correctly, ensuring it is represented as `-0.0`.
+
+**Fixed Function:**
+
+To fix the issue, we need to adjust the spacing logic to handle negative zero and ensure proper separation of minus signs.
