-    @Override
-    public void feedInput(byte[] buf, int start, int end) throws IOException
-    {
-        // Must not have remaining input
    if (_inputPtr < _inputEnd) {
        _reportError("Still have %d undecoded bytes, should not call 'feedInput'", _inputEnd - _inputPtr);
    }
+   ```
+   This checks if there are any undecoded bytes before feeding new input. If there are, it reports an error.
+
+2. **Validate input parameters:**
+   ```java
    if (end < start) {
        _reportError("Input end (%d) may not be before start (%d)", end, start);
    }
-        // and shouldn't have been marked as end-of-input
+   ```
+   Ensures that the end index is not before the start index.
+
+3. **Check if end-of-input has been marked:**
+   ```java
    if (_endOfInput) {
        _reportError("Already closed, can not feed more input");
    }
-        // Time to update pointers first
+   ```
+   Prevents feeding more input if the end-of-input has been reached.
+
+4. **Update pointers:**
+   ```java
    _currInputProcessed += _origBufferLen;
+   ```
+   This line accumulates the total bytes processed so far.
 
-        // Also need to adjust row start, to work as if it extended into the past wrt new buffer
+5. **Adjust row start:**
+   ```java
    _currInputRowStart = start - (_inputEnd - _currInputRowStart);
+   ```
+   This seems to adjust the current row start based on the new input. It might be where the offset calculation goes wrong.
 
-        // And then update buffer settings
+6. **Update buffer settings:**
+   ```java
    _inputBuffer = buf;
    _inputPtr = start;
    _inputEnd = end;
    _origBufferLen = end - start;
-    }
+   ```
+   Sets the new input buffer and updates pointers.
+
+Given the test failure, it appears that the byte offset tracking is incorrect, specifically in how `_currInputProcessed` is being updated.
+
+### Proposed Fix
+
+To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `_currInputProcessed` accurately reflects the total bytes processed up to the current point. One possible problem is that `_origBufferLen` might not correctly represent the length of the original buffer.
+
+Let's adjust the update of `_currInputProcessed` to directly account for the bytes processed before feeding new input.
+
+Hereâ€™s the revised `feedInput` function:
