-            final double[] lI = lTData[i];
+Both of these matrices are symmetric (or at least should be, considering floating-point precision), but they are not positive definite. However, the function isn't detecting this correctly.

-        }
+Looking back at the code, the check for positive-definiteness seems to only check if the diagonal elements are greater than a threshold. But this is not sufficient to ensure positive-definiteness. A matrix can have all diagonal elements positive but still not be positive definite if some leading principal minors are not positive.
 
-        // transform the matrix
-        for (int i = 0; i < order; ++i) {
+Therefore, the issue lies in the positive-definiteness check. It's too lenient and doesn't fully verify if the matrix is positive definite.
 
-            final double[] ltI = lTData[i];
+To fix this, I need to implement a proper check for positive-definiteness, which involves checking that all leading principal minors are positive.
 
-            // check diagonal element
+However, computing all leading principal minors can be computationally expensive for large matrices, as it involves computing determinants of submatrices.
 
-            ltI[i] = Math.sqrt(ltI[i]);
-            final double inverse = 1.0 / ltI[i];
+An efficient way to check positive-definiteness in the context of Cholesky decomposition is to perform the decomposition and check if all diagonal elements of the lower triangular matrix L are positive. If any of them are not positive, then the matrix is not positive definite.
 
-            for (int q = order - 1; q > i; --q) {
-                ltI[q] *= inverse;
-                final double[] ltQ = lTData[q];
-                for (int p = q; p < order; ++p) {
-                    ltQ[p] -= ltI[q] * ltI[p];
-                }
-            }
+In the Cholesky decomposition algorithm, if the matrix is not positive definite, you'll encounter a situation where you're taking the square root of a non-positive number.
