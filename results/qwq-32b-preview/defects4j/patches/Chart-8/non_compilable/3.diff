   public Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {
       // defer argument checking...
       this(time, RegularTimePeriod.DEFAULT_TIME_ZONE, Locale.getDefault());
   }
+  ```
+  
+- **Issue:** The constructor is delegating to another constructor that uses `RegularTimePeriod.DEFAULT_TIME_ZONE` and the default locale, which might not respect the provided `TimeZone` and the locale settings for determining the start of the week.
+
+- **Test Analysis:**
+  - The test sets the default locale to Danish (Denmark), where the first day of the week is Monday.
+  - It creates a `GregorianCalendar` for August 26, 2007, and expects the week number to be 34.
+  - Then, it changes the default locale to English (US), where the first day of the week is Sunday, and expects the week number to be 35.
+  - However, the test fails because it gets 34 instead of 35 for the US locale.
+
+## Solution
+- **Approach:** Ensure that the `Week` constructor correctly uses the provided `TimeZone` and the appropriate locale to determine the start of the week.
+
+- **Fix:** Modify the constructor to use the provided `TimeZone` and the locale associated with it to determine the first day of the week.
+
+- **Code Fix:**
+
+  ```java
+  public Week(Date time, TimeZone zone) {
+      // Use the provided timezone and default locale to create the Week instance
+      this(time, zone, Locale.getDefault(zone));
+  }
+  ```
+
+- **Explanation:** By using `Locale.getDefault(zone)`, we ensure that the locale associated with the provided time zone is used. This should correctly determine the first day of the week based on the locale settings, thereby calculating the correct week number.
+
+## Final Solution
+To fix the issue with the `Week` class constructor not correctly determining the week number based on the provided date and time zone, we need to ensure that the constructor uses the appropriate locale settings for determining the start of the week.
