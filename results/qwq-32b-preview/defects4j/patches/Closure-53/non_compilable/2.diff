+3. **Replacing the Original Node:**
+
+   - Depending on whether the original node is a `VAR` statement or an assignment expression, it replaces it with the new expression.
+
+   This part seems fine, assuming the replacement node is correctly built.
+
+Given that the test is failing for both `var a = {};` and `a = {};`, but only the assignment case is erroring out, it's possible that the way the nodes are being handled differs between these two cases, and the bug triggers in the assignment case.
+
+Looking back at the code, one potential issue is that the `nodes` list might have different lengths in different scenarios, and the loop that builds the comma-separated tree might not handle all cases correctly.
+
+Let me consider a simpler way to build the comma-separated expression.
+
+Instead of manually building the tree with loops, I can use a recursive approach or a utility function to create a comma-separated sequence of nodes. This might be more reliable and less error-prone.
+
+Alternatively, I can use the `NodeUtil.createCommaChain` utility if it exists, or create a similar helper function.
+
+For now, I'll try to simplify the way the comma tree is built.
+
+Here's an idea:
+
+- Start with the last node in the list.
+
+- For each preceding node, create a comma node with the current node and the accumulated tree.
+
+- Continue this process until all nodes are included.
+
+This way, the tree is built correctly, and the order of evaluations is maintained.
+
+Let's try implementing this.
+
+First, reverse the nodes list so that the first node in the new list is the last one to be evaluated.
+
+Then, initialize the replacement node with the first (original last) node.
+
+Then, iterate through the remaining nodes and prepend them to the replacement node wrapped in a comma node.
+
+Here's how it might look:
