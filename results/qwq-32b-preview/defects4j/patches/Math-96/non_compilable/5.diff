+   This is efficient and correct.
+
+2. **Check for null:**
+   ```java

+   }
+   ```
+   Also correct.
+
+3. **Cast and compare:**
+   ```java
+   else  {
        try {
            Complex rhs = (Complex)other;
            if (rhs.isNaN()) {
                ret = this.isNaN();
            } else {
                ret = (Double.doubleToRawLongBits(real) == Double.doubleToRawLongBits(rhs.getReal())) && (Double.doubleToRawLongBits(imaginary) == Double.doubleToRawLongBits(rhs.getImaginary()));
            }
        } catch (ClassCastException ex) {
            // ignore exception
            ret = false;
        }
    }
+   ```
+   Here, it's trying to cast `other` to `Complex` and then compare the real and imaginary parts using `Double.doubleToRawLongBits`, which is a good way to compare doubles for equality, including handling NaN correctly.
 
-        return ret;
-    }
+However, the test is failing, which suggests that either the casting is failing (but the catch block should handle that), or the comparison is not recognizing equal complexes as equal.
+
+Let me consider the multiplication operation in the test:
+
+`new Complex(0,1).multiply(new Complex(-1,0))`
+
+Multiplying two complex numbers:
+
+`(a + bi) * (c + di) = (a*c - b*d) + (a*d + b*c)i`
+
+So,
+
+`(0 + 1i) * (-1 + 0i) = (0*(-1) - 1*0) + (0*0 + 1*(-1))i = 0 - i`
+
+Which should be equal to `new Complex(0, -1)`.
+
+Now, why are these two instances not considered equal?
+
+Possible issues:
+
+- The `multiply` method is returning a complex number with different bit representations for the same value.
+
+- There's a sign difference in zero that's not being handled correctly.
+
+Wait, Java's double has signed zero, where `0.0` and `-0.0` are distinct but equal in value. The bit-level comparison using `Double.doubleToRawLongBits` would consider them different.
+
+In the `Complex` class, do we need to consider `0.0` and `-0.0` as equal?
+
+According to the Java language specification, `0.0.equals(-0.0)` returns true, even though their bit representations are different.
+
+However, using `Double.doubleToRawLongBits`, `0.0` and `-0.0` would have different bit representations.
+
+So, in the `equals` method, if both real and imaginary parts are zero, but with different signs, should they be considered equal?
+
+In mathematical terms, +0 and -0 are equal, so yes, they should be considered equal.
+
+Therefore, the current implementation might be incorrectly considering `0.0` and `-0.0` as different.
+
+How to fix this?
+
+Instead of using `Double.doubleToRawLongBits`, we can use `Double.valueOf(real).equals(Double.valueOf(rhs.getReal()))` and similarly for the imaginary part. This way, `0.0.equals(-0.0)` returns true.
+
+Alternatively, we can check if both values are zero and consider them equal regardless of sign.
+
+But using `Double.equals` is cleaner and handles all cases, including NaN.
+
+Wait, but NaN is tricky because `Double.NaN.equals(Double.NaN)` returns false, since `Double.equals` delegates to `double` equality, and NaN is not equal to itself.
+
+But in the `equals` method, there's a special case for NaN:
