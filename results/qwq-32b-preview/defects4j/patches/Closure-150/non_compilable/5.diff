+   (function() {
+
+     var goog = {};
+
+     /** @param {number} x */ goog.foo;
+
+   });
+
+   ```
+
+   The test expects that `goog` has a property `foo` with type `function (number): ?`, and that `lastLocalScope.getVar("goog.foo").getType()` equals `goog.getPropertyType("foo")`.
+
+2. `testCollectedFunctionStubLocal`:
+
+   ```javascript
+
+   (function() {
+
+     /** @constructor */
+
+     function f() {
+
+       /** @return {number} */ this.foo;
+
      }
+
+     var x = new f();
+
+   });
+
+   ```
+
+   Here, it expects that `x` has a property `foo` with type `function (this:f): number`, and that the property type is not inferred.
+
+From the errors, it seems that the property types are not being set correctly in the symbol table.
+
+Looking back at the `visit` method:
+
+- It handles function inputs if the node is an LP token and its parent is the root node.
+
+- It attaches literal types to the node.
+
+- Depending on the node type, it defines functions, catches, or variables.
+
+The problem might be in how it handles property accesses or in how it defines variables and functions within namespaces.
+
+In the first test, `goog.foo` is being annotated with `@param {number} x`, which suggests it's a function that takes a number parameter. However, in the code, `goog.foo` is not being defined as a function but rather as a property access.
+
+I suspect that the `visit` method isn't properly recognizing and handling property assignments or annotations.
+
+Similarly, in the second test, `this.foo` inside the constructor is being annotated with `@return {number}`, indicating a function that returns a number. Again, it seems that the `visit` method isn't correctly capturing this property's type.
+
+Possible issues:
+
+1. The `visit` method doesn't handle property accesses correctly.
+
+2. When encountering a property annotation, it's not associating the type with the correct symbol in the symbol table.
+
+3. The `defineVar` or `defineDeclaredFunction` methods aren't handling namespaced variables properly.
+
+To fix this, I need to ensure that when a property is annotated, its type is correctly recorded in the symbol table, especially for namespaced properties.
+
+One approach is to modify the `visit` method to handle property accesses and annotations appropriately. Perhaps by traversing the property chain and updating the type for the deepest property.
+
+Alternatively, there might be a separate method or hook in the compiler that handles type annotations for properties, which I need to ensure is being called.
+
+Given that I only need to fix the `visit` method, I should look for ways to make it aware of property types and update the symbol table accordingly.
+
+Here's a possible modified version of the `visit` method:
