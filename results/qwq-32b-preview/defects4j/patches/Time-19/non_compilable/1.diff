-     * millisUTC   == millisLocal - getOffsetFromLocal(millisLocal)

-     * This method will return an offset suitable for calculating an instant
-     * after any DST gap. For example, consider a zone with a cutover

-    public int getOffsetFromLocal(long instantLocal) {
-        // get the offset at instantLocal (first estimate)
    final int offsetLocal = getOffset(instantLocal);
-        // adjust instantLocal using the estimate and recalc the offset
+   ```
+   This gets the initial offset assuming `instantLocal` is already in the local time.
+
+2. **Adjusting the Instant:**
+   ```java
    final long instantAdjusted = instantLocal - offsetLocal;
    final int offsetAdjusted = getOffset(instantAdjusted);
-        // if the offsets differ, we must be near a DST boundary
+   ```
+   Here, it adjusts the instant by subtracting the initial offset to estimate the UTC time and then gets the offset for this adjusted time.
+
+3. **Checking for Offset Difference:**
+   ```java
    if (offsetLocal != offsetAdjusted) {
-            // we need to ensure that time is always after the DST gap
-            // this happens naturally for positive offsets, but not for negative
-            if ((offsetLocal - offsetAdjusted) < 0) {
-                // if we just return offsetAdjusted then the time is pushed
-                // back before the transition, whereas it should be
-                // on or after the transition
-                long nextLocal = nextTransition(instantAdjusted);
-                long nextAdjusted = nextTransition(instantLocal - offsetAdjusted);
-                if (nextLocal != nextAdjusted) {
-                    return offsetLocal;
-                }
-            }
+       // handle DST boundary
    } else if (offsetLocal > 0) {
-            long prev = previousTransition(instantAdjusted);
-            if (prev < instantAdjusted) {
-                int offsetPrev = getOffset(prev);
-                int diff = offsetPrev - offsetLocal;
-                if (instantAdjusted - prev <= diff) {
-                    return offsetPrev;
-                }
-            }
-        }
-        return offsetAdjusted;
+       // handle potential previous transition
    }
+   ```
+   If the offsets differ, it indicates a DST transition, and the code attempts to handle it by checking if the offset difference is negative and adjusting accordingly.
+
+### Identifying the Bug
+
+The bug seems to be in how the function handles the transition from BST to GMT. In London, when DST ends, the clock is set back one hour, causing an hour to be repeated. This is a DST overlap situation.
+
+In such cases, the function should favor the earlier instant. However, the current implementation appears to be picking the later instant or not handling the overlap correctly, resulting in an incorrect offset being applied.
+
+### Correcting the Function
+
+To fix this, we need to ensure that during a DST overlap, the function chooses the earlier instant. Also, we need to make sure that during a DST gap, it chooses the later instant.
+
+Here's a revised version of the function:
