-    public Complex reciprocal() {
    if (isNaN) {
        return NaN;
    }
+   ```
+   This checks if the complex number is NaN and returns NaN appropriately.
 
+2. **Zero Check:**
+   ```java
    if (real == 0.0 && imaginary == 0.0) {
        return NaN;
    }
+   ```
+   Currently, this returns NaN when both real and imaginary parts are zero. However, according to the test, it should return infinity in this case.
 
+3. **Infinite Check:**
+   ```java
    if (isInfinite) {
        return ZERO;
    }
+   ```
+   This returns zero if the complex number is infinite. This seems counterintuitive because the reciprocal of infinity should be zero, but according to the test, reciprocal of zero should be infinity.

+4. **Reciprocal Calculation:**
+   The rest of the method calculates the reciprocal based on the magnitudes of the real and imaginary parts.
+
+Given these observations, the issue lies in how the method handles the zero case. We need to modify the method so that when both real and imaginary parts are zero, it returns infinity instead of NaN.
+
+Additionally, we need to ensure that the reciprocal of infinity is zero, which seems correct in the current implementation.
+
+Here is the corrected version of the `reciprocal()` method:
